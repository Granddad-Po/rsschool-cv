## About Myself:

For a long time I was looking for my direction. I managed to try myself in Web design, photography, vector graphics,
architecture, sales, etc.) At the moment, I’m ready to take the path of Front-end development with full confidence,
before that I studied Java, but the front seemed closer, more visual and more interesting to me. If I set tasks for
myself, I can’t calm down until I complete it (this is seriously facilitated by my perfectionism and the buzz I get from
closing tasks). I want to grow in my chosen specialization and deepen my skills. Making convenient software for people
from people.

## Code Example:

This code demonstrates the use of basic encryption using a numeric key to encrypt and decrypt a text message. The whole point is to raise each character in the string to a power by the numeric value of the key. We do the same for decryption.

```javascript
function isPangram(string){
  string = string.toLowerCase();
  return "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
      .split("")
      .every(function(x){
    return string.indexOf(x) !== -1;
  });
}
```
