For a long time I was looking for my direction. I managed to try myself in Web design, photography, vector graphics,
architecture, sales, etc.) At the moment, I’m ready to take the path of Front-end development with full confidence,
before that I studied Java, but the front seemed closer, more visual and more interesting to me. If I set tasks for
myself, I can’t calm down until I complete it (this is seriously facilitated by my perfectionism and the buzz I get from
closing tasks). I want to grow in my chosen specialization and deepen my skills. Making convenient software for people
from people.
